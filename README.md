# SSTI-Automation-demo-

This code tests for server side template injections on query parameters found vi gau , if target does not filter input like { } and uses some template engines,it will find out.Happy with aiohttp performance, much better than urrlib3 or requests module which was a real pain to use with multi threading, they hung most of the time when making too many concurrent requests.aiohttp has a lot of built in functionality,will use this module in all the other multi threaded requests.

This is just a demo , Improved it a lot for the last 3 days but can not reveal the code.
